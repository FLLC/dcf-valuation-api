# DCF Valuation Model (API-Based)

This project implements an **automated Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** valuation model that retrieves company financial data via API and computes intrinsic share value.  
It combines **financial modelling** and **programmatic data automation**, demonstrating how valuation models can be scaled and automated in Python.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**  
> The external API used for this implementation was developed internally by one of my teammates at **Team Delta** (our student investing association).  
> As I no longer have access to the API, this project is shared **for demonstration and educational purposes only**, showcasing the logic, structure, and design of an automated valuation pipeline.

## üìä Overview
The model consists of two main modules:

- **`wacc_via_API.py`** ‚Üí Calculates the **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)** using CAPM, company balance sheet data, and debt structure retrieved through `yfinance`.  
- **`DCF_via_API.py`** ‚Üí Uses the computed WACC to estimate **Free Cash Flows (FCF)**, **Enterprise Value**, and **Fair Value per Share** through a structured DCF process.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Automated financial data retrieval through a private API (Team Delta) and Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)
- Dynamic calculation of:
  - **WACC** (risk-free rate, beta, cost of debt, market premium)
  - **Free Cash Flow projections**
  - **Terminal value** and **intrinsic share price**
- Built-in error handling for API calls and missing data
- Modular and well-documented Python structure

## üß† Methodology
1. **Data retrieval** ‚Äî Fetch balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement data from the Team Delta API (formerly hosted at `iveurope.eu`).  
2. **WACC calculation** ‚Äî Compute the company‚Äôs weighted average cost of capital using CAPM assumptions and balance sheet data.  
3. **DCF model** ‚Äî Forecast Free Cash Flows (FCF), compute present values, and derive the intrinsic share value.  
4. **Output** ‚Äî The model returns both the **market price** and the **DCF-estimated fair value**.

## üß∞ Used
